## 🧠 What is Kabadi Wala?

Kabadi Wala is a web platform built using **Bolt.dev** that connects users with waste collectors and enables efficient, category-based garbage pickup. It also promotes sustainability by offering an **eco-point reward system**, where users earn points for recycling and can redeem them in an in-app marketplace.

We're also developing a companion mobile app (UI in **Figma**) featuring a **Garbage Report Tool** to help governments track cleanliness and waste trends.
